I am an applied economist interested in development microeconomics, focusing on gender, conflicts and agricultural production.

Currently, I am the Project Investigator in charge of the randomized impact evaluation of the [Sahel Women Empowerment and Demographic Dividend (SWEDD)](https://sweddafrica.org/) initiative in Mali, a women's empowerment project. Gender-related, focusing on mothers, is another randomized impact evaluation of a parental training program in Nepal I am in charge of - toghether with two other colleagues at Paris-Dauphine - that aims at improving early childhood development. 
I also have a special interest in social norms and attitudes, how to measure them and their inter-generational transmission. Together with Mary Di Santolo (Uni Dauphine), we are assessing the impact of reservation quotas for women in India and the transmission of gender social norms. At the cross-roads between conflict and gender, I coordinate a research project on the measurement of attitudes about gender-based violence and towards authoritarian regimes in collaboration with an international and interdisciplinary network of researchers. Together with Sikandra Kurdi (IFPRI) we are assessing the impact of the current civil conflict in Yemen on trust and cooperativeness measured with a lab-in-the-field. Recently, we also began a randomized impact evaluation of a Cash-for-Work program in Yemen.

Previously, during my PhD at the Paris School of Economics, I have been investigating farmers' agricultural production investment decisions and technology knowledge diffusion in rural Uganda with the East Africa Dairy Development project initiative.

I enjoy teaching Public Policies in Developing countries and Development Micro-Econometrics to second year Master students, as well as Micro-econometrics, Stata and Gender Economics to first year Master students at Dauphine.
