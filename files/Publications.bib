abstract = {Gender-based violence (GBV) is widespread across the world. While the majority of the literature focuses on women as the victims of GBV, this paper studies men’s justifications for and perpetration of GBV in Mali, one of the countries with the highest GBV prevalence rates in the world. We elicit the prevalence of eight GBV-related opinions and behaviors among men in Bamako, the capital city, by administering a set of list experiments that we compare to a set of direct questions to estimate response biases. We find large support for GBV: nearly one respondent in two supports female genital mutilation or intimate partner violence. Besides, one in four has already physically hit an adult woman. Our results also show that several questions suffer from significant response biases when asked directly. Support for female genital mutilation is overreported, with actual approval being lower than openly stated. Conversely, justification of intimate partner violence is underreported, likely due to social pressure against it. While response bias varies little with respondent characteristics, prevalence rates are systematically lower among men with a secondary level of education. Our results are in line with response bias being shaped by the legal framework addressing GBV as well as prevailing social norms, highlighting the need for caution when using data collected through direct questioning.}

    abstract = {The farmer trainer (FT) model has gained momentum as a cost-effective alternative to traditional agricultural extension systems. However, there may be friction in the transmission of information, whereby farmers closer to the FT may benefit more than socially distant farmers. This study explores whether variations on the standard FT model facilitate the diffusion of information outside the FT’s pre-existing social network. On top of a standard FT training, a sub-sample of voluntary FTs in rural Uganda was randomly assigned to receive (i) vouchers for accessing professional extension agents, (ii) a signpost advertising the trainer services or (iii) further training aimed at tailoring the training to the specific needs of the trainees. The results show that the FTs assigned these treatment variations trained more farmers, a larger proportion of whom belonged to the FT’s own close circle. The FTs who received vouchers were the only ones to reach out to more socially distant farmers and were also those who organized the most training sessions. We show that these effects are independent of any FT prominence in the village. Nevertheless, further evidence suggests exercising caution regarding the presence of friction in the transmission of knowledge, since knowledge and technology adoption appear to increase only among farmers closely connected to the FT.}

abstract = {In standard household surveys, the data collected are exposed to response bias, particularly for questions considered sensitive. The List Experiment method is an alternative survey technique for limiting these biases. This article presents the results of an experimental survey conducted using this method with 1,509 individuals throughout Mali. Individuals were surveyed by telephone during the summer of 2021 about their experiences and political attitudes related to insecurity. From a methodological point of view, we have drawn a number of lessons from the survey: among others, a very good understanding and acceptability of the method by the respondents, due in particular to the quality of the interviewers and supervisors; the need for a more complex sample design than for a standard questionnaire; and the importance of a short questionnaire when surveying by telephone. From an analytical point of view, the survey reveals the existence of significant social desirability biases - particularly for questions concerning political attitudes in relation to insecurity.}

abstract = {Despite the international community’s emphasis on the need to achieve food security, there is still much debate surrounding its measurement, due mainly to its multidimensional aspects. This paper investigates the capacity of a new type of measure, food security scales, to capture dimensions of food security that other measures, such as food expenditures, caloric availability and food diversity, may miss. Drawing on nationally representative household panel data from Malawi, Nigeria and Tanzania, I find that the scale is a useful complementary measure to standard measures. Cross-section and panel analysis shows that the scale provides further insights into food vulnerability and coping strategies characteristic of food insecurity, dimensions not captured by the standard measures.}
